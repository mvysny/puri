# pikuri-seci

A Siri-style desktop assistant for Linux and GNOME, on top of [pikuri](https://codeberg.org/mvysny/pikuri).
A global shortcut pops up a search bar; you type, and the bar grows into a streamed conversation,
with every earlier conversation one click away in the same window.
It reads and writes your notes and reminders and can search the web, but never opens a URL, and
the model runs on your own machine whenever it can.

Pikuri owns the agent loop, the tools, the prompts and the LLM transport. This project owns the
popup window, the conversation history beside it, and the resident process that keeps the agent
warm.

**Status:** design only, nothing to run yet. `pikuri-seci` is a working name; the plan, the name
included, lives in `design/ideas/`.
